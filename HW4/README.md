HW4:

This assignment involves document classification. 

We have three categories, legal, marketing and engineering

The goal here was to create an automated end-to-end solution for document classification and sorting.

I ended up using a random forest classifier to do this, with decent results. The f1 scores for the engineering and marketing categories was around 0.75.

The model seemed to be better at handling the legal category, with an f1 score of 0.84
