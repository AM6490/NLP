Final Project:

This was a group project with three other students on a topic of our choice. 

We decided to analyze Apple price data with respect to twitter sentiment regarding the company. 

The goal was to determine whether it was possible to generate predictions based on sentiment scores created by the price data in comparison with sentiment scores generated by twitter data.

Our group employed several models, particulaly LSTM's, FinBERT (fine-tuned using MLM), and VADER. 

The LSTM was used to predict stock prices while FinBERT and VADER were used simultaneously to process and predict sentiment scores for the twitter data 

We found that the models were quite good at making predictions and fitting to data during positive trends. 

However, the model struggled to fully anticipate swings in negative trends, and also proved unable to accurately predict trends during periods of high volatility. 

This was expected, since machine learning models cannot predict volatile exogenous events very well due to their unpredictability.
