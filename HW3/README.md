HW3:

In this assignment I explored word probabilities in different texts, these includes topics like machine learning, fishing, hiking, and mathematics. 

The function is called word_prob and assigns scores based on whether a certain number of tokens from a target group of words appears in each folder. 

The keywords I used are machine learning, fishing, hiking, and mathematics and we check each folder for these respective words. 

E.g., I check if the word 'fishing' ever appears in the machine learning text folder, or if 'hiking' appears in the mathematics folder.
